# Movies-ETL
This project collected movie data from multiple sources (JSON file of wikipedia movie data, and Kaggle MovieLens data) cleaned it, and uploaded the data into a postgreSQL database. The code and readme for this process can be found in the ETL folder.

After the database was created the data was loaded into pandas to perform exploratory data analysis. Mainly the trends between budget and revenue were examined. This process can be found in the correlation folder.
